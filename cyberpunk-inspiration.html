							<p><span>The</span> 80s-90s art style for cyberpunk had an appeal to its players becasue it made the game more relatable to them while also being enitrely <span>different.</span>
							This allowed for the player mind to envision themselves in this fantasy easily cause the art of their time was <span>implemented</span> well.
							</p>
							
							<p><span>Other</span> sci-fi genres around this time that are considered to be caterorized as cyberpunk also had an <span>impact</span> on some things in cyberpunk the Rpg.
							For instance, the <span>Terminator</span> was released around the same time as Cyberpunk and uses some of the same looks in Cyberpunk.
