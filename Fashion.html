										<p>It's true; you don't have to look good to be street solo. But dressing down has
										its limits. You're not going to get teh big jobs: extracting major corporates, guarding
										big-name vidstars, or covering media security on the important parties. For that kind of work, you have 
										to <b>look</b> the part. The eurosolos I know always been partial to Gibson when they're on the job;
										it's tough durable, and has a lot of flai. For a young solo on the way up,you can't do much bette; its the 
										enforcer's equivalent of the 500eb grey flannel suit. --Morgan Blackhand
