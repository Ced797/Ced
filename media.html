						<p><span>Cyberpunks</span> in general have usally been presented differently than what <span>the actual</span> people that are cyberpunks. Cyberpunks are normally shown
						as gothic people,with a european aestheic. While some aspects of this <span>sterotype</span> might be true with some people who are cyberpunks it does not show those who
						play the all the table-top games, and <span>dive deep</span> into the lore of Cyberpunk.
						</p>
						<br>
							<p><span>Contrary</span> to this there are the nerdy type of cyberpunks who are seen as typical <span>nerds,or hackers.</span> Both of these
										<span>representaions</span> have been in media before. Although these are the represenations of cyberpunks in media and hold some truth they are not the 
										definitive or accurate represenation of the sub-culture.

							<p id="one"><span>Putting</span> these audience together as one group does not really pose any difficulties since when it comes to Cyberpunk the <span>aesthetics,</span> story, style, and feel of the overall product matter and people from both sides can <span>acknowledge</span> what is or is not Cyberpunk based off those factors. 
							The older fans can be into the videogame and it is possible yet, it may not be as common 
							as them simply being people who <span>respect</span> and appreciate the entire <span>sub-genre</span> of Cyberpunk as a whole.

							<span>Older audiences,</span> that still continue to play Cyberpunk would most likely play the newest Cyberpunk tabletop which is <span>Cyberpunk Red</span> by Mike Pondsmith. 
							This is because it is a direct follow up to the events of Cyberpunk 2020 and the precursor to Cyberpunk 2077 the videogame. The searches from Google Analytics on Cyberpunk 2020 show that has been a 
							<span>spike</span> in interest since the both the videogame and tabletop RPG games and since the second showing of Cyberpunk at the <span>electronic entertainment expo,</span> 
							E3, that tells us that this certainly is spiking the interest of those who have enjoyed and played the <span>previous versions</span> of Cyberpunk RPGs while also attracting new people.
